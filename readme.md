In the fast-paced urban landscape, the significance of efficient movement and the challenges posed by increasing traffic are more apparent than ever. To address these issues, we have leveraged the knowledge gained from the open-source software (OSS) lecture, along with GitHub and OpenCV, to develop the 'Pedestrian Analysis System on the Road.'

Our system is dedicated to enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency by real-time analysis of pedestrian movements on roadways. As we continuously gather and utilize pedestrian data, we aspire to contribute to the ongoing improvement of urban infrastructure, envisioning a future where our efforts lead to safer and more efficient transportation systems.

Particularly noteworthy, we have integrated code to recognize smiling expressions using a camera, adding an engaging aspect to our innovative project.

While our project represents a modest step in exploring future road systems and tackling traffic issues in modern cities, we firmly believe in the transformative power of small efforts. We eagerly anticipate the collective impact of initiatives like ours on building a safer and more efficient transportation system for the cities of tomorrow.

Thank you for your attention!
